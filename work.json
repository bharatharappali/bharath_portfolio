      "description": "Refoundry is a unique Italian platform that brings together young, talented professionals and small to medium-sized businesses (SMEs) looking for new leadership. The platform aims to preserve business legacies while injecting new energy and expertise into the acquired SMEs. It's an exciting opportunity for both young talent seeking new challenges and founders and owners of SMEs looking to secure their legacy. <br> <br>The concept of the visual Identity stems from the intergenerational exchange that the platform strives to achieve. Wave diffraction was chosen as a metaphor for depicting the concept, which is reflected in the logomark and the visual imagery.",
